How you feel about the concept as a whole?

-Love the idea but would the rent module be really needed ?

Would you prefer fetching data or downloading bank statements and importing them?
-Fetching, downloading statements seems a bit long

 
 Web based or phone app
- Phone App

Where would you like the flag? Home ? module ?
- notification 

Stand alone vs server-client (major calculations  done on server)
-Server client 


Anything else you would like to input.
-A clothes app would be nice
- Have a monzo type card with it, that way you dont need to worry about any data access
