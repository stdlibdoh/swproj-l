# Aron Dry Cleaners App

## Introduction

This app will act as a useful tool for a dry cleaning company where I worked in the past. I have already spoken with the owner of the factory and he is very interested to use this app. Firstly I need to explain how this business runs in a nutshell. This dry cleaning company has a few branches (shops) where the customers bring the clothes to be washed. In every branch there is somebody that will take the customers clothes and creates one ticket for him and a copy for the customer or more (generally only one ticket per customer). Every ticket has an unique number, the customer name, how much he had paid, his phone number, the number of items and what items he has brought. The guy from the branch, pins every items from a specific order with that unique number from the ticket so the guys from the factory will know how to sort every item. After the driver takes all the orders along with the tickets to the factory where everything is washed and cleaned. When the orders are ready the driver takes them to the branch along with the tickets. Now the orders are ready to be pick-up. 

## Description

I want this app to have different restrictions depending which user is going to use it. The first type of users will be the guys from the branches. Their duty is to create e-tickets after creating the normal ones. The app will calculate automatically how much the customer has to pay after selecting the items. The second type of users will be the guys from the factory. They will have access to see all the e-tickets from every branch, helping them in case some tickets are lost or damaged. The third type of users will be the customers helping them to track their orders and receiving a notification when they can come to collect their stuff.  Another functionality that I want this app to have is to create a report for the owner of the factory whenever he wants to see how much he has earn, how many items and what type of items have been cleaned. I want him to have a clear report of his business. 

## Goals

This app will help the owner of the dry cleaning to see a very accurate report of his business, helping him to plan his expenditures. The guys who work in the factory have a lot of problems because some tickets get lost, some of them are damaged and some tickets have a hard to see hand writing. All this problems will be solved. Furthermore the clients will be able to see the status of their order. 

## Target Audience

The main target of this app is the personal of Aron Dry Cleaners including the owner. It will improve this business by covering a good part of their problems.

## Resources

1)  Java: Being the most common language used in creating Android Apps, I think that we need to know how to use it.  This year we are going to learn Java so I donâ€™t see this resource as a problem.
2)  Swift/Object-C: Our software is intent to be use in a business environment so the product needs to run on every type of operating system used by phones.  So we need to use an IOS version, which may be a little problematic due to our lack of knowledge in this area.
3)  Database 


## Deployment Stages

There will be 3 stages: 
1)	Using the app for only one branch 
2)	Using the app for 2 branches
3)	Using the app for all branches


## Monetizing

This is an university project, so I do not want money for releasing this app. In case there will be a big success and other dry cleaning companies will want the same apps, of course in that case we will charge them.

## Timeline
1)	End of November: The template of the app to be ready on paper.
2)	Mid-January: All the members be ready for coding the app.
3)	TBD

## Issues

1)	 The main problem of this software is the data that will be inserted by the guys from the branches. For a 100% correct report they need to add a 100% data when they make the e-tickets. All the results will be decided by their skills on using the app.
2)	During the day the guys from the branches need to have their mobile data open when they create the e-tickets. They always need to be very careful when using mobile data, because the app will not work without it.
3)	Developing an Android and IOS software is not so easy especially that we are only 4 in our group, and we need to acquire a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time.
