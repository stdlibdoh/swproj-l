## Data Protection Act 1998 ##
https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents

The Data Protection Act is designed to protect personal data stored on computers. It gives individuals legal rights to control information about themselves. It mainly does not cover domestic use, but anyone holding personal data for other purposes is legally obliged to comply with this act.
The data protection Act sets out eight principles:

1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless –
  * (a) at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and
  * (b) in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.
  
2. Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.

3. Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.

4. Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.

5. Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.

6. Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act.

7. Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.

8. Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.


## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ##
http://www.eugdpr.org/

This is a new EU regulation that will come into enforcement on 25th May 2018. Although it is not active now and Britain is leaving the EU it is important to consider while creating our product.

The principles of the GDPR are similar to those in the DPA with added detail at certain points. The largest change is the accountability principle which requires you to show how you comply with the principles within the GDPR.
 
In the GDPR article 5 requires that personal data shall be:
1. Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;

2. Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;

3. Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;

4. Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;

5. Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals;

6. Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.
