## Monzo ##
https://monzo.com/

Monzo is trying to create a new way to do banking with a purely online bank. The app makes it easy to monitor your money within the spending section. The spending section gives you a breakdown of your transactions and splits them  into categories like:
* Shopping
* Eating out
* Groceries
* Transport
* Entertainment
* Expenses
* Bills
* Cash withdrawals
* General

Inside each category is every transaction related to it or it can be viewed as each merchant used. For example, this is what the groceries section looks like:

Monzo also allows you to plan budgets  so you can manage and track your spending. it  will then send you “intelligent” notifications to tell you if you are spending too fast and are not likely to stay within your budget target for that month.

## Money Dashboard ##
https://www.moneydashboard.com/

Money dashboard aims to be a finance assistant and budget planner to help people make better financial decisions. It gives you access to all of your bank accounts so you can view them in your dashboard.

This also breaks down your transactions into categories similarly to Monzo (bills, income, enjoyment etc) but it offers visuals in the form of a range of graphs.

Within the  categories you can set yourself budget goals, so if you want to cut down on groceries you can track how much you have left to spend for this month given the goal you have set yourself.
