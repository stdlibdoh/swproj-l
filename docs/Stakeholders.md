## Introduction

Our software project acts as a money planner/saver.  Before starting to develop this app we need to take a look of how other people can be affected or affect our concept. Let’s focus on stakeholders.

What is a stakeholder? It can be a man, group or organization that has interest or concern in an organization. In our case, their concern will be our software.  Some example of key stakeholders are creditors, directors, employees, owners (shareholders), suppliers, and the community from which the business draw it’s resources. Due to the fact that we are creating a university project and we don’t have creditors, directors, and so on, the key stakeholders will be represented by people aged 18-50.
 
The best way to achieve a plan that every person (group supervisor, module leader, expert people from IT industry) which will analyze our project is to present a software that meets the expectations and/or needs of the key stakeholders. Thus, the task of performing an analysis of the stakeholders interest cannot be related to one of the less important facets of the project.

## Stakeholder Analysis

Our project is acting as a money advisor app so a stakeholder is represented by a person who is aiming to save money in a high priced area such as London. One could be a student which we all know that almost student have problems with money, and every pound counts. Another one could be a parent of two baby child and wants to find a way to pay less money on baby stuff. Another one could be a poor person who is new in London and wants to constraints his spending. We can say that our software can be used by people aged between 18 and 50 years old who are interested in saving money.

## Conclusion

The team members went and talk with the key stakeholders at the beginning of the project. We took useful information but the most important is to see how they define project success (their expectations). Then we can go and use this information to adapt our project. In this way we made a stakeholder analysis by specifying their interest, influence and expectations regarding our project. After this we saw how we can manage each customer expectations.
