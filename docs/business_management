- Taking count of how many orders/refunds has been taken
- Taking count of employee clock in/out
- Taking count of the quantity of items in the store
- Show monthly earning and tax
- Ordering Items automatically if the quantity of it go under the preselected value

## Goals

This software will be build taking count of any special requirement needed for any kind business and reducing the cost and time behind the process of creation of a software for every business.

## Target Audience

At the start our client will be the owners of small groceries/restaurant around our university since they are the employers that don&#39;t have money to invest on software for their business

## Resources

- An object orientated language that allow communication between different Class and Methods. And the language that we are going to use is Java since it&#39;s a language that allow to create software that will work with any type of platforms
- A Database that will store and show all the data of the business

## Deployment stages

- Using a local groceries store to test our project on the early development
- Make the software available worldwide after completion

## Monetising

After the completion and bugs fix we could sell the software for a onetime payment.

## Timeline

- From November to December: we will have regular meeting and research
- Before Christmas Holliday we will divide the work
- Start of new semester we will start on the creation of the assigned parts

## Issues

- if the data stored in the database are not encrypted properly the client can lose crucial information of his/her business.
