# Concept framework

## Introduction

This will be a collection of bullet points aimed at having consistency across our individual contributions to the pool of ideas for the group project. It is by no means comprehensive so add/edit it as you see fit.

## Concept name

Placeholder name for the project

## Description

Brief description of what the project is about

## Goals

List every issue that the project aims to solve. In my case, regarding the "money-saver" project, it will simply be a way to help people save money, by tapping into the lifestyle of London being unsustainable to most. List marketability as well and why it could work. 

## Target Audience

The scope of this topic is the initial phase of deplyment. Again, in my project, the initial scope will be Goldsmiths students, seeing as most students are thin on cash. List possible steps towards market/user research

## Resources

List resources that will be used in the production of the project. App development would mean coding/learning Java/Kotlin for Android or Swift/Objective-C for iOS development. Further resources would mean have a dedicated server handling traffic, domain registry, and others.

## Future Plans / Deployment Stages

List what the project could turn into, given the time and/or resources. Deployment stages for my project would mean an initial stage using Goldsmiths students as a test bed, Stage 2 being deploying to university students and Stage 3 being general population.

## Timeline

This will be entirely conceptual and open to changes but if you could include some form of targets to be met by so and so date. So maybe by 1st of December, look into infrastructure. By 1st of January, learn basics of language, and others.

## Issues

Be really detailed here. It's important to show our supervisor that we are aware of issues that might arise. List possible solutions but don't dwell on them too much. At this stage we're still just debating which concept to go with
