# Money-saver App (Placeholder Name)

## Description

This project will be an app that intends to act as a money planer/saver. Its core concept is having the user feed some data to build a somewhat accurate predictive model, with some decisions being required in case of an innacurate bank statement tag. It would then calculate how much disposable income the user has, being monthly/anually. From there, it would cross the data it already has with available online data to see where the user could save money. An example would be to cross available groceries data with how much a similar shopping list would cost in a different one. Another example could be how much rent the user is paying and what kind of living accomodations he/she/they has/have, i.e. one bedroom, studio flat. It would then compare with average rent in different places, according to set parameters such as distance to work, and estimate how much money could be saved and when could technically be the ideal time to move. 

## Goals

Saving money is probably in every londoner's head. This project aims to fill that need by utilising existing products and data into one simple package. It is also meant to fully expand on the benefits of such data, if better explored.

## Target Audience

Initial user research will be based on Goldsmiths, University of London, students, as most students struggle with dealing with money (be it from a lack of experience or due to London just being London), and as there's close proximity to them. After prototyping, the intent is to release it to general public, following what is outlined in "Deployment Stages".

## Resources

+ Java/Kotlin and app development skills: As computer science students, we're already learning Java and I feel that's a good starting point. Releasing an Android app is also arguably easier to do than an iOS one. On top of that, Swift/Objective-C read very differently from Java/Kotlin and, as such, I feel we should only pursue one of the possible deployment environemnts. 

+ Servers: Still in its initial stage but I feel that most of the computational operations should happen outside the user's machine, to avoid stressing the device. Scrapping for data should only happen every once in a while, so costs would most likely be based on customer access.

## Deployment stages

There will be 3 deployment stages, regarding a working prototype:

+ Using Goldsmiths, University of London, as a test bedroom

+ Soft release to university students in the UK

+ Deploy app to general population

## Monetising

There is no plans to monetise this project. I understand that some people equate marketability with monetisation but I personally put more value in customer outreach. I understand this is a university project but, if we were to be talking about a real life scenario, the purpose of this project would be to get acquired and move on. 

## Timeline

These will all be rough dates and subject to many changes.

+ Mid-November: User research that points to a decent rate of acceptance, of around 70%, by the target audience.

+ Mid-January: Translate acquired Java knowledge into app development and familiarisation with Android Studio.

+ TBD

## Issues

+ Inquire whether there's any legal implications our team should be aware of as we're technically dealing with financial data. The fact that it is completely up to the user might be enough to stop any complications that might arise.

+ A Terms and Conditions would have to be drafted, stating that we are not responsible for users spending more money than what our project suggests. No one in our team speaks legalese.

+ Wondering if the fact that the user physically has to input the data (be it in the form of exporting a statement to .pdf/.xls) might have some impact on acceptance. However, I feel that a further selling point and a fix to it could be to reiterate security.

+ Security. Some form of encryption would have to wrap any kind of customer data.

+ Most bank statements don't detail groceries. There are products available that turn a physical receipt into workable data, however, that further expands on point 3.
